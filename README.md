Too Many Keybinds is a mod that aims to bring action keys to all keybinds in your Minecraft game.
It is meant to be used with modpacks where you will have hundreds of keybinds but only so many keys on the keyboard.
Ideally this will be able to run with any mod but I am yet to test it with other mods.

The way it works right now is that when you press an action button, it disables that keys modifier (I dont know how to virtually press a modifier key),
and sets the key itself to whatever you set the TMK keybind to. By default it is 'Y'. So if you have a key that is SHIFT+U, 
it'll disable the SHIFT, set U to Y, press Y, and then reset the keybind back to SHIFT+U. This means the only keybind that needs to be
non-conflicting is the TMK keybind. It also can't have a modifer (I don't know how to work around them so I remove them).

This is a passion project of mine so I want to be able to complete these goals myself, but I am also not a programmer so I may not be able to
complete my task. At the end of the day though, it will be fun to try!
